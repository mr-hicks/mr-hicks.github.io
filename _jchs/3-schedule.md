Outline of the 2019-2020 Schedule.

Final each semester is to work on a personal goal/project using the practices (planning, organization, reflection, etc) to complete it.
At the end of the semester the students have to present their goal/project to either you or the class.
We grade them on how well they do the process of their project.

As a side note, we as their teachers should also work on a project and keep the students informed and aprised of how we are working on our own project.
Our own deadlines, goals, notes, progress, etc.
Then demonstrate our own projects to them at the end.

# Fall - About 40 days
## Starting - 9 days
  * Intro
  * Bank Statemets
  * Permeter Foundations of Science
  * Note taking activities
  * Setting up lab notebook
  * IIHS Collision - 2 days, one build, one test
    * HS-PS2-3. Apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a macroscopic object during a collision.*
  * Model of an electron
    * HS-PS4-3. Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.
  * Board con - students teach students in mini-sessions

## Motion
### 2nd Law
  * Lab - measure the acceleration due to gravity
  * Standards
    * HS-PS2-1. Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.
    * ?? HS-ESS1-4. Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system.

### Conservation of Momentum
  * Lab - Perfect bowling shot - which ball, where to hit
  * Field trip - Bowling Alley?
  * Standards
    * HS-PS2-2. Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system.


### Conservation of Energy
  * Lab - One shot
    * A swinging hammer that strikes a ball up a ramp then lands on a target.
    * Hammer is potential -> kinetic (with momentum!) -> ramp will have gravity on the fall!
  * Standards
    * HS-PS3-1. Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.
    * HS-PS3-2. Develop and use models to illustrate that energy at the macroscopic scale can be accounted for as a combination of energy associated with the motions of particles (objects) and energy associated with the relative position of particles (objects).
    * HS-PS3-3. Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into anotherformofenergy.

## Electricity
### Intro
  * Electricity onto motion
  * Electro statics
  * Magnetism
  * Standards
    * HS-PS2-4. Use mathematical representations of Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects.

### Multi-component systems
  * Lab is to light up lights in a different pattern?
  * Standards
    *

### Electro-magnetism
  * Lab - Build the best speaker (They have to make the voice coil, arrange the magnets, pick the cone, etc.)  We'll need an amplifier for every room, I have, two off hand...
  * Lab - Or, make a generator and have a contest to make the most efficient generator?  We would have to have a rig to test them, and the requisit materials.
  * Standards
    * HS-PS2-5. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current can produce a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current.
    * HS-PS3-3. Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into anotherformofenergy.
    * HS-PS3-5. Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction.



## Research Paper?
  * Standards
    * HS-ESS3-1. Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
    * HS-ESS3-2. Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios.
    * HS-ESS3-3. Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among management of natural resources, the sustainability of human populations, and biodiversity.
    * HS-ESS3-4. Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
    * HS-ESS3-6. Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity.

# Spring - About 40 days
## Research Paper?

## Waves/Radiation
  * Standards
    * HS-PS4-1. Use mathematical representations to support a claim regarding relationships among the frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media.
    * HS-PS4-2. Evaluate questions about the advantages of using a digital transmission and storage of information.
    * HS-PS4-4. Evaluate the validity and reliability of claims in published materials of the effects that different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter.
    * HS-ESS1-1. Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.
    * HS-ESS1-2. Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe.

## Atoms
  * Standards
    * HS-ESS1-3. Communicate scientific ideas about the way stars, over their life cycle, produce elements.

## Chemsitry
  * Standards
    * HS-PS3-4. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that the transfer of thermal energy when two components of different temperature are combined within a closed system results in a more uniform energy distribution among the components in the system (second law of thermodynamics).

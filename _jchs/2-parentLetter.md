For the 2019-2020 school year the Physical Science teachers are switching to standards-referenced grading.
Our goal is to increase clarity when communicating what students actually know or can do.

<!--more-->
There are three pillars to the the science standards passed down to us by the state of Kansas.

  * Disciplinary Core Ideas
  * Science and Engineering Practices
  * Crosscutting Concepts

Our standards are based off of those three pillars.

# Standards vs Points
A standard is a level of knowledge or demonstration of skill that your student shows.
Rather than work towards and accumlate points, it is the demonstration of a skill or idea that earns a grade.

To emphasize this difference we are shiftinging from a percentage based system to a numerical scale; 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

A 1 means that the student is just developing the concepts.
A 2 means that the student possesses the foundational knowledge required.
A 3 means that students have reached the expected level of understanding.
A 4 means that the student has reached an advanced level of understanding.

In general:
  * 1 is about a D
  * 2 is about a C
  * 3 is about a B
  * 4 is about an A

For your students transcript, we will convert their grades to a typical letter grade.



# Our standards
  * Core Ideas
  * Practices - Lab Notebook
  * Practices - Lab Reports

Throughout both the core ideas and the practices we will incoproate the crosscutting concepts.

## Core Ideas
Throughout the year we will have different units.
Each unit will end with a written test.
The average proficency of ALL of these tests will determine your students grade for this standard.

## Practices - Lab Notebooks
Your student will keep a lab notebook for the entire year containing all of their notes, experimental observations, and classwork throughout the semester.

This standard is a cummulative standard.

Once a week we will sit down with your student and have a conference where we discuss where they are at with the material.
At this time we will review their lab notebook with them, reflecting on the quality of their notes, clarity of writing, obervations about experiments, and so on.
Based on this meeting we will assign a score of 1-4 for that week.
The score we assign during the final week will be the final score of that sememster.

Students are learning to organize their thoughts and we do not expect them to be perfect from the beginning.
We instead expect students to grow throughout the sememester, reaching the expected level by the end.

As such we have two different proficiency scales, one for each sememster.

## Practices - Lab Reports
Each unit will have a single over-arching lab where students will have to develop and test the basic model that the unit is covering.
At the end of the unit, after the test, there will be a work day for the students to finish compiling their observations and notes into a final lab report.

This is essentail because communication is a fundemental aspect of ALL endevors.

This standard is also cummulative.
The students final score will be determined by the last lab report of the sememster.

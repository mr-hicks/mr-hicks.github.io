Welcome to my website.

Couple of things, I'm new to this teaching thing, and if you are curious to know more about me, then check the about page.

If you are here because you are hungry for good food, check the recipes page for various things I have served to others.

If you are here as a student, then head over to the Students page for the classroom content that I have compiled/created/curated for you over there.
There are sections on:

  * Motion
  * Atoms
  * Chemsitry
  * Lab reports

If you are here as an educator, head over the Educators page where I have been working on designing lessons to match with the 9th grade Physical Science Standards.

Sincerely,
Mr. Hicks

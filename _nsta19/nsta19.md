# Summary of NSTA 2019
Hello all, I had the fortunate opportunity to go to the NSTA conference this year.

Being new to teaching I focused on learning about how people teach science, both the content presentation and grading sides of things.

There are three major things I learned, standards grading, teaching science as modeling, and pacing and instruction.

# Standards Grading
[Materials from the session](./Adventures in Flipped-Mastery.pdf)

The presenters were three chemistry teachers in Missouri that teach in a public high school.
They all three work together to make sure that all of their content is aligned and all three have a flipped classroom model.
Each of them has videos of them covering the content on youtube, and all videos are available for all the students.
So if one student prefers another teachers style, they can watch those videos.

I do not anticipate that we will adopt a flipped model any time soon, but having options for the students to watch seemed to be good for the students.

The more helpful thing was their grading system.
Attached is a copy of their standards for a unit and two examples of how they present their tests.

They broke the content for any given unit down into levels

  * developing
  * foundational
  * expected
  * advanced.

Each level is then tested separately and sequentially and EVERY student must take the different levels.
For a student to pass a level they must demonstrate mastery by getting better than a specified percentage for that tier.

| Tier | % for Mastery |
|:-----:|:---------------:|
| Developing | 90 |
| Foundation | 90 |
| Expected | 80 |
| Advanced | 70 |

Each page of a tests is one of the tiers and students can stop at any point they want, determining their maximum grade.

They also mirrored the tiered structure in the way the presented the material to the students.
Every student would work through the foundational/developing folder on Schoology.
They clear that section by passing a quiz with randomly selected questions from a bank.

Once they clear a section the next opens up.

As for pacing, everyone goes at the same pace, they differentiate based on the level that students get to.
They have conversations with students as to the tier they are on, and where they will end up.

# Teaching Science as Modeling
Another session I went to was about the particle wave duality of electrons given by the [Perimiter Institute](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca).
The content was not what was import, rather it was how they described science.

The premise is that you get the the result that electrons act both like a wave and a particle, but what you really have is two different models that are equally valid in their prediction of an electron.
The presenters were very clear that it everything was a model, and that what were developing was a model and that no one model predicted everything but rather both were used.

There were two consequences of this for me.
First, this is an example of the leading edge of science, we have these models, but no model is 'right'.
This is a great example of how to teach kids that science never says something is 'right', rather we say we have a good model that makes these predictions.
Leaving the possibility open for more and better models later.
This is why scientists never give a 'right' answer.

Second, it illustrated the importance of using, evaluating, and creating a model to solve a problem.
This allows for growth, rather than stating everything as absolute.
Example, as kids grow we give them more and more complicated models.
All are correct, we just have to start teaching them the boundaries of the models too.

What this means to me is that I need to teach everything as models, with varying stages of using, evaluating, and creating.

Now, a couple of the other sessions I went to talked about problem-based learning and phenomena-based learning, which I do believe will be a great way to introduce the models to the students.

Oh, I forgot to mention, another point was that scientists test a model by finding the cases in which it fails, rather than simply confirming it true and moving on.
The validity is defined by the occasions that it doesn't work.

# Uncertainty in Scientific Argumentation
Immediately following the modeling class I went to one on uncertainty in scientific argumentation.

The problem as the presenters presented it is that students are un-aware or unable to account for uncertainty in their arguments.
Their example as a student was writing a paper arguing a point they did not really believe because their data and other evidence only partially supported the claim.
Writing in other classes taught them that they had to believe and fully commit to their claim, whereas in science, having an inconclusive result is perfectly valid.

What they then modified and proposed is the ['Italian Flag Analysis'](./Including Uncertainty in Scientific Argumentation.pdf).
Essentially it is a graph with three regions, a green evidence for, a white uncertain section, and a red evidence against.
By including a section of unknowns when building your argument you can decide if something is likely true, false, or uncertain based on the sizes of the three regions.
If you are uncertain, you can then also better pinpoint your uncertainties.

This provides a good frame work for evaluating models, what works, what doesn't, and what don't we test.

# Self-Pacing in Science
The last topic I'll summarize is about self pacing in science.
The following is a combination of all of those sessions.

In every case, teachers kept a given pace with their class.
What they modified was the quantity of work given.
Advanced students would make it deeper into a given topic, and other students would get a more foundational knowledge.
What they varied was the depth of content, not the number or range of topics.

Second, was that all teachers had a firm and hard test date.
They always offered quizzes of some sort with retakes before the tests, but most of the students grades were determined by the tests, with a bit of adjustment based on the work completed in class and other things.

Students were allowed to flex out their time however because in all cases the classrooms were a flipped model where the teachers would have materials prepared ahead of time so that students could learn basics outside of class.
Often the emphasis was then on doing the work in class so that the teacher could eliminate (or reduce) students 'practicing' errors in their work.

Also, by keeping one pace, only labs for a given unit could be happening at the same time, reducing the number of possibilities at any given time.

The last thing they all had in common was that at the very start of every class there would be a demonstration of either problems or techniques so that the students would always get started right away and provide incentive for students to arrive on time.


# Notes to self
IIHS classroom for materials and labs based on driver safety

* Especially important at this age
* A good way to start of the semester with activities


## Teaching science as models

* Evaluateing, using, and creating models
* Explain that any model that allows us to make predictions is good
* Also explains why there is no 'truth' in science
* An inconclusive result IS a valid result in science
* Incorporate problems or penomina as the basis for learning, help students engage.

## Pacing and Instruction

* Begin every class with a teacher led activity to begin cleanly.
* Keep a given pace for all students, this allows for group activities.
* Creat an over-arcing narrative to tue units and content

## Grading

* Levels of understanding define the grade, with different percents for mastery of each grade.

## Mysteries
  * Miracle of the day - have students record their own observations and then have them find explainations to some
  * Make students develop their own questions with help and guidence
  * Claim charts to help them guide their discussion.
  * Students **must** revise a model for it to be a model.
  * Zoom-in, have students add zoom ins to show what is physically happening on a smaller scale.  Such as gasses in a room, etc.
  * Have students collect phenomena to demonstrate that they understand a concept.  If students can correctly identify relevent phenomena then they have the basic concept and ideas down correctly.
  * Lookup QFT, the question formulation technique.
  * Teach students how to read and give them a science lens.


## Self-Paced Science
  * "Studio Thinking" by Lois Hetland - The presenter was at an arts school so the whole school ran on a studio model.
  * Was flexible because of the demands on the students time.
  * Demo at the start of class to make sure that class started on time.
  * Keys on the table so that the students could check their own work.
  * Emphasized that the practice should always be right so that students don't 'learn' the wrong behaviors.
  * Labs that can't be done fully at the time they are done.  Some of the analysis must be done later as students learn more. - similar to the revising of models.
  * They had a supervised test room that the students could go take their test when ready.

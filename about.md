## About Me
I'm transitioning to teaching from an engineer.
In college I started out as a Math and Engineering major, but found engineering classes rather boring.
Hence I started to take more Physics classes instead.
However my engineering advisor convinced me to go to graduate school for engineering.
After graduating undergrad with degrees in Math and Physics, and a Music minor, I headed off to get a PhD in Engineering.

My one claim to fame is that I recieved an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
I did not finish my PhD, though not for lack of effort, more for a mismatch between my advisor and myself.
Before finally turning my PhD work into a Masters though, I did work for about 8 years as a research engineer in my advisors company studying microcavitation.
In regular people terms, little tiny bubbles that go 'pop'.

In transitioning out of engineering I sat down, not in one sitting of course, and figured out that my needs were not being met as an engineer because I needed more positive social interaction and to contribute more directly to helping people.
Hence, I decided that becoming a teacher would be best.

Thus far, I'm loving it.
It is more work than I've ever had to do, but it is good work so I'm happy.

## About this website
As I believe in the open source community all of my content is saved on Github and hence I'm using Github Pages.
This allows for all past versions of lesson plans and materials to be available without cluttering up folders.
Allowing for their to be one, and only one, file tree for my teaching materials.

This is the based on the default Jekyll theme minima.
You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
In addition to the Jekyll documentation, I also went through the [Jekyll for Web Designers tutorial](https://github.com/jameswillweb/jekyll-for-designers) [lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com) course.

## Past ideas
This is my website containing resources and plannbook.
It is divided into two general segments, students and educators.
The students should see blog posts indicating what is done on each day with links to any needed info as well as assignments.
The edu page will list the units for which I have taught, then link to the unit lesson plans as well as the reflection pages over how each lesson went.
There should be a 1:1 corrolation with student assignment/resource posts with edu assignment/resource/reflection posts.
The front matter will be the same with the addition of a reflection section.

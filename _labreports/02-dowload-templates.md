title: Downloading the Templates
---
For all of your future lab reports, it will be useful to have the templates already on your computer.  If you already have all of your lab reports started, make sure to download the templates and put them in the template folder.

Downloading the templates
Go to schoology and go into the 'Lab Reports Resources and Assignment' folder.  Now go into the 'Templates, Rubrics, and Assignments' folder.  Download the multi experiment template and then move it or save it to the 'Physical Science/Templates' folder you made earlier on your computer.

Repeat for the 'Single experiment' template.

>**Step by step**
>  * Once you have opened the 'Lab Report Template Multiple Experiment.rtf' file, click >the download arrow in the upper right.
  * If you are using Chrome:
    * the file will appear in a small bar at the bottom of the web browser, there will be a little arrow on the right side, click the arrow and then click on 'go to the file location'
  * If you are using Edge:
    * the file will download and then you have the option to open, save, or something O donâ€™t remember.  Click the save, and if you see the option click 'save as'.
	 * If you click 'save as', find the 'Physical Science/Templates' folder you made earlier, and save the file there.
	 * If you click 'save', you will have to find out where it saved (most likely your downloads folder) and then copy the file over.
  * OR, if you want, apparently you can drag the file from the ribbon on the bottom to the folder.
  * To copy a file, you can either click the file, then click the button that is along the top that says copy, or if that button is not visible you can click 'Home' (just to the right of 'File').  My preference is to use the keyboard shortcut of 'Ctrl+c' for copy, and 'Ctrl+v' for paste, 'c' is for copy, and 'v' is paste since 'v' is right next to 'c' on the keyboard.
  * Once copied, navigate over to the 'Physical Science/Templates' folder and paste the file, either using the paste button at the top, or using the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+v' or the right click menu option.


Making your blank lab reports
For any lab reports that you have yet to start, you need to have a black copy to start with. To get that blank lab report you copy the proper template from the template folder then paste it into the main folder and rename it.  The goal is to have a folder that looks like this:

    Physical Science/
        L01 - Measures.rtf            **multiple experiment**
        L02 - Candybar Density.rtf    **single experiment**
        L03 - Energy of Fuels.rtf     **single experiment**
        L04 - Ice cream lab.rtf       **single experiment**
        L05 - Chemical Reactions.rtf  **multiple experiment**
            Templates/
                Multi experiment template.rtf
                Single experiment template.rtf

>**Detailed**
  * Copy the proper template from the templates folder
  * Go back to the 'Physical Science' folder.  You can do this by click 'Physical Science' up in the search bar at the top of the window
  * Paste the file into the folder, either by pressing the button at the top, right clicking and selecting the option, or using the 'ctrl+v' shortcut.
  * Rename the template to be the proper name.  To rename, either click once on the file and it should bring up the cursor to change the name, or you can press 'F2' to bring up the rename option.

Next, download the lab station handouts for all of the labs.  Rename them so they sit next to the experiment files in the folder.  See the final folder structure you should have below.

    Physical Science/
        L01 - Measures.rtf
        L01 - Measures Handout.pdf
        L02 - Candybar Density.rtf
        L02 - Candybar Density Handout.pdf
        L03 - Energy of Fuels.rtf
        L03 - Energy of Fuels Handout.pdf
        L04 - Ice cream lab.rtf
        L04 - Ice cream lab Handout.pdf
        L05 - Chemical Reactions.rtf
        L05 - Chemical Reactions Handout.pdf
            Templates/
            Multi experiment template.rtf
            Single experiment template.rtf

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FOLDER SETUP AS ABOVE.
IF YOU DO NOT, THE RAISE YOUR HAND FOR HELP.

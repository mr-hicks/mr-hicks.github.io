Currently when I grade lab reports, I basically go through with a checklist. If you have everything on the checklist and have those bits correct, you get all the points.

Below, are basically those checklists.

## L01 - Measures
Look at the walkthrough.

## L02 - Candybar density
### Introduction
There should be three parts:
  
  * Question - copied from the lab handout
  * Research about the question with 1 source
  * Hypothesis - stating whether or not you think density changes with size

### Materials/Setup/Procedure
#### Materials
3 things, the object being measured, and the two objects that are doing the measuring.

#### Setup
Either N/A, or say that you put the wax paper on the balance.

#### Procedure
4 steps, one for each of the measurements you record.  If you only say 'measure the candy bar', that is incorrect.

### Data/Results

  * The following table (or more) completely filled out.

|    | Mass (g) | Length (cm) | Width (cm) | Height (cm) | Volume ($$cm^3$$) | Density ($$\frac{g}{cm^3}$$) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|Whole  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|1/2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|1/4  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

  * Use the correct number of decimals on the mass (1)
  * Use the correct number of significant digits on the volume (2)
  * Use the correct number of significant digits on the density (2)
  * Have all the correct units.

### Conclusion
Two things

  * Say whether your data agrees with your hypothesis, and why
  * Any sources of error in the lab


## L03 - Energy of Fuels
### Introduction
Your goal is 'compare the energy content of ethanol and wood'.
If you included other things, you still get the points, but the point is NOT to compare the temperatures of the fire.

### Materials/Setup/Procedure
#### Materials
A shortened list from the handout, we did not use everything, and I do not want to to include things like the computer, that is assumed.

#### Setup
Describe the ring stand setup that is holding the can.

#### Procedure
There should be a step for each measurement taken.

### Data/Results
The following table filled out.
Note there are 5 more rows that are the 5 calculations that follow in the lab handout.
You do not calculate the energy content till the 5th calculation, hence you cannot compare the energy content.

|    | Ethanol | Wood |
|----|---------|------|
|Mass(g) - fuel + dish  |  |
|Mass(g) - dish | |
|Mass(g) - can | |
|Mass(g) - can + water | |
|Temp(C) - starting | |
|Temp(C) - ending | |
|----|---------|------|
|Temperature change of water (C) | |
|Mass of water heated (g) | |
|Energy of fuel burned (J) | |
|Mass of fuel burned (g) | |
|Energy content of fuel (J/g) | |

Note how they all have units.


### Conclusion
Two things:

  * Which fuel has a higher energy content, ethanol or wood (based on your data)
  * Any place you think you had errors.


## L04 - Ice cream
### Introduction
Two things:
 
  * State that the goal was to make ice cream.
  * Cite a recipe

### Materials/Setup/Procedure
#### Materials
List your ingredients with METRIC units.

#### Setup
N/A

#### Procedure
Accurately describe which ingredients go into the bag to make the ice cream mixture, and which ingredients go into the bucket to make the salt/ice/water mixture.

### Data/Results
Three things

  * List any compromises you had to make when budgeting
  * Explain why you salt the ice.  Note, it makes nothing colder.  What it does is lowers a very specific temperature for the ice/water mixture.
  * Explain how the heat flows between the ice cream mixture and the salt/water/ice mixture.  Note their are only two possibilities:
    * The heat flows from the ice/salt/water mixture into the ice cream mixture.
    * The heat flows from the ice cream mixture into the salt/water/ice mixture.

    Answers involving how the ice melts are NOT correct.

### Conclusion
Two things:

  * How did your ice cream turn out?
  * What would you change


## L05 - Chemical Reactions
### Introduction
Simply say something about practicing handing chemicals and observing chemical reactions.

### Conclusion
Simply say how you safely handled chemicals and observed chemical reactions.
Oh, and mention which was your favorite.

### Lab Introductions
Just say what you are going to do with words.  Example, `We are combining aluminum and hydrochloric acid to observe what happens.`

### Materials/Setup/Procedure
#### Materials
  * List the chemicals used and their amounts
  * Any equipment needed to measure things
  * Any equipment needed to handle the chemicals

#### Setup
  * List the safety procedures

#### Procedure
  * Describe the order you combined your chemicals.
  * How you dispose of the chemicals

### Data/Results
Three sections

  * Before - describe what each chemical looked like
  * During - describe what happened while the reaction was taking place
  * After - What did the end result look like.  Example `After the aluminum reacted with the hydrochloric acid, it was a clear liquid once again.`

### Lab Conclusion
Two things:

  * Balanced chemical equation - see the handout for the equations
  * What type of reaction it was.  These are the four reactions we had in class:
    * Synthesis
    * Decomposition
    * Replacement
    * Combustion


## L06 - Conservation of Mass
### 1-3
Simply record your observations, if you were absent, then simply say so in those blanks and you'll receive full credit.

### 4-6
The hard part is getting the correct molecules on the product side since I don't give them to you.
Here they are:

  4.  __ NaOH + __ Ag[NO3] --> __ AgOH + __ Na[NO3]
  5.  __ CaCl2 + __ Na2[CO3] --> __ NaCl + Ca[CO3]
  6.  __ KI + __ Pb[NO3]2 --> __ PbI2 + __ K2[NO3]2

### 7
Google it

### 8
Which of the products in 4-6 are insoluble.
Use the insolubility chart.

### 9
Ask a friend.

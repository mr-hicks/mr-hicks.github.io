Select and replace `[name]` and put in your own name, note, Jeffrey Hicks is correct, [Jeffrey Hicks] is NOT correct.

Select `[Date the lab was done]` and insert the proper date.
If you are like me and do not remember when we did a lab go to the front page on schoology and look up the date on the schedule.

Then highlight the `[Name]` and insert the title of the lab, in this case it is **Measures**.

## Introductions
For introductions there will be some combination of:

  * goal
  * question
  * research
  * hypothesis

Sometimes it is just a goal - the measures lab; a goal and research - the ice cream lab; question, research, and a hypothesis - density lab; etc.

The introduction should tell the reader what you are going to do, simply and clearly.  You do not need to have all of the details, just the general idea is important.

For the measures lab, the overall point is found in the lab station handout.

`Practice using the metric system by making measurements of various objects.`

> **Microsoft Word Hint**
If you donâ€™t want to see all the page breaks when working on your report, you can click the little paper with a globe on it at the bottom right hand-side of the word window.  This puts Word into web mode and it gets rid of most of the page related formatting.

From here, each of the introductions for each experiment should fall under the scope of the overall introduction.  Getting more specific to the experiment at hand.

Now go ahead and change all experiment headings for each of the experiments.  

>### Experiment 1 - `Linear`
>
>### Experiment 2 - `Mass`
>
>### Experiment 3 - `Volume`
>
>### Experiment 4 - `Temperature`

So, for the introduction of the Linear experiment we have to narrow the scope from 'practice using the metric system' that we used in the introduction for the whole lab.  Since this is measuring we are going to describe what we using to measure, what it measures, and what unit it is in the metric system.  So, for the linear one, we are using a meter stick to measure cm, the metric unit of length.  Hence our introduction is:

`We are practicing using a meter stick to measure cm, the metric unit for length.
See how it is more narrow than the general one, and specific to the linear measurement.`

From here we can write the rest of the introductions.

>### Experiment 1 - Linear
>#### Introduction
>`We are practicing using a meter stick to measure cm, the metric unit for length.`

>### Experiment 2 - Mass
>#### Introduction
>`We are practicing using a balance to measure grams, the metric unit for mass.`
    
>### Experiment 3 - Volume
>#### Introdcution
>`We are practicing using beakers and graduated cylinders to measure mL, the metric unit for volume.`
    
>### Experiment 4 - Temperature
>#### Introdcution
>`We are practicing using the thermometer and the temperature probe to measure celsius, the metric unit for temperature.`

## Materials/Setup/Procedure
This is easiest when compared with recipes.  When you get things out of the cabinets to start cooking, that is the materials.
Then the steps you have to do before you actually start cooking, preheating the oven, chopping vegetables, etc, are the setup.
The procedure then is the actual cooking part, the order you and ingredients, the cooking time, etc.

For all of the experiments you need:
  * The objects you are measuring
  * The objects you are using to measure
  * Any objects that are are supporting

Meaning, you have to have the meter stick, book, penny, and table for the linear lab.

For the setup, you can skip it for all of these experiments except the temperature experiment.
The reason is none of the other labs have any steps between getting out the materials, and taking the data.
In the temperature lab you have to get out the materials, then setup (well, I did) all of the samples so that they maintain their proper temperature.

For the procedure you have to outline the order for every measurement.  You do not have to explain how to take the measurement, but you must have a step for each measurement.

Here goes:
>### Experiment 1 - Linear
>#### Materials
>  * `Meter stick`
>  * `Book`
>  * `Penny`
>  * `Table`
>
>#### Setup
>`N/A`
>
>#### Procedure
>  * `Lay down the book, measure the length with the meter stick.`
>  * `Repeat for the penny and table.`

Pay attention to how each experiment has the object doing the measuring, the objectsthat are measured, then explains the order the measurements were made.
This is not important here when each experiment has one step (except the volume measurement), but it is important for the candy bar density.

Here are the rest of the experiments:
 
>### Experiment 2 - Mass
>#### Materials
>  * `Balance`
>  * `3 Pennies`
>  * `Graduated cylinder`
>  * `Wood Block`
>
>#### Setup
>`N/A`
>
>#### Procedure
>  * `Measure the mass of the penny.`
>  * `Repeat for 3 pennies, the wooden block, empty graduated cylinder, and the cylinder with 10mL of water in it.`  


>### Experiment 3 - Volume
>#### Materials
>  * `Various graduated cylinders and beakers`
>  * `Water bottle`
>  * `Yellow vial`
>  * `Plastic storage bowl`
>
>#### Setup
>`N/A`
>
>#### Procedure
>  * `Fill the water bottle with water`
>  * `Pour it into the 600mL beaker and measure the volume of water`
>  * `Fill the yellow vial with water`
>  * `Pour the yellow vial into the 10mL graduated cylinder to measure the volume of water`
>  * `Fill the plastic storage bowl with water`
>  * `Pour it into the 600mL beaker to measure the volume of water.`

>### Experiment 4 - Temperature
>#### Materials
>  * `Theromemter`
>  * `Temperature Probe`
>  * `Water - Cold`
>  * `Water - Room temp`
>  * `Water - Boiling`
>  * `Alcohol - Cold`
>
>#### Setup
> * `Place ice into the cold water to keep it cold`
> * `Place the cold alcohol into an ice water bath to keep it cold`
> * `Place the boiling water over a burner to keep it simmering`
> * `Leave the room temperature water out on the counter`
>
>#### Procedure
> * `Use the thermometer to record the temperature of the room temperature water`
> * `Use the temperature probe to record the temperature of the room temperature water`
> * `Repeat both measurements with each of the other samples.`

##  Data/Results
For each of the 4 experiments you need to make a table.  Look at the handout to figure out what needs to be included in each table.  For each experiment the data was collected in one unit, and the table has other units too.  This is so you get practice converting to different units.  You can get data from the data handout on Schoology, or I have printed copies.

>**Set-by-step**
>Click under the Data/Results section then go up to the 'Insert' button at the top of Word.
>One of the options is to insert a 'Table'.
>It brings up this little graphic where you can highlight the size of a table you want to make. 
>Count out the row and columns you need based on the table shown in the lab handout.

If you have no idea how to do the conversions, you can just type them into Google.

## Conclusions
The conclusion is where you wrap everything up in a neat bow.  You take the data you have collected and then respond back to your introduction.  For this lab, it is rather trivial (unlike how the data collected in the others influences your conclusion).  All you do is repeat the introduction.  So say:

>### Experiment 1 - Linear
>#### Conclusion
>`We practiced using a meter stick to measure cm, the metric unit for length.`

>### Experiment 2 - Mass
>#### Conclusion
>`We practiced using a balance to measure grams, the metric unit for mass.`

>### Experiment 3 - Volume
>#### Conclusion
>`We practiced using beakers and graduated cylinders to measure mL, the metric unit for volume.`

>### Experiment 4 - Temperature
>#### Conclusion
>`We practiced using the thermometer and the temperature probe to measure celsius, the metric unit for temperature.`

All I did was change the tense from going to, to did.

Then for the overall conclusion (back at the top of the page), simply repeat the introduction with the change in tense.

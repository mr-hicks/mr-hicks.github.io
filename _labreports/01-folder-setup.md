title: Science Folder Setup
---

First things first, you need to have an organized folder so that you can keep track of your lab reports and the support material.  By the end of this section you will have a Physical Science folder and its requisite items and sub folders.

In either your documents folder or your name folder (example, jeffreyhicks), make a new folder called 'Physical Science'.  You should have a folder for all of your classes here.  If you want you can add a meaningful prefix to the folder such as the block you have it, such as 'W1 - Physical Science', that way they are automatically sorted as you probably think of them.
 
>**Hints**
  * You can also access your files by pressing 'Windows+E' on the keyboard.  The 'e' stands for 'explorer', because your file browser is called 'Windows Explorer', it explores your 'Windows', just as 'Internet Explorer' explored the internet.
>
>  * To make a new folder you can either press the ’New Folder’ button at the top of the 'Explorer' window, or if that button is not present you can click on 'Home' that is just to the right of 'File' on the window bar.  Additionally you can press 'Ctrl + Shift + n', the ’n' stands for new.

Once you have a 'W1 -  Physical Science' folder, you need to make a subfolder for templates.  This is where you will keep the two templates for both a multi-experiment lab report and the single-experiment lab report.
 
Currently you should have:

    jeffreyhicks/
        Stuff
        W1 - Physical Science/
            Templates/
        More stuff

 
> **Explanation**
> 
> The '/' when writing computer stuff means folder, hence 'Templates/' is a folder, 'Templates' is a file.
> Also, when something is tabbed in it means that it is a subfolder.

**ONLY MOVE ON IF YOUR FOLDER IS SETUP
IF IT IS NOT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND ASK**

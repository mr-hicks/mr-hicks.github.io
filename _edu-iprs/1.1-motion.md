Students will calculate the distance, velocity, and acceleration of an object given stop motion images of its movement.

Standards: None, building foundations for H2-PS-2 Motion and stability.

Vocabulary: distance (d), velocity (v), acceleration (a), slope

Equations:
  
  * velocity = slope of distance
  * acceleration = slope of velocity

## Assessment
  * Students will submit their graphs indicating their calculations
  * Quiz matching vocabulary to the different terms (2nd day)


## Outline

  1. Video games to demonstrate the words
  2. Activity to pracitce using the words
  3. Record a video of an object in motion
  4. Plot the movement, calculate the velocity, and acceleration by hand (2nd day)
  5. Note quiz at the end of the day
  6. Extra credit if you can make an excel sheet that will do the appropriate calcuations by hand before the next class

### Activity 1
Students will play 3 different games to learn the differences between the three different words.
  * Snake to illustrate constant speed
  *

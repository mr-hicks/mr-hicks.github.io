Students will calculate the distance, velocity, and acceleration of an object given stop motion images of its movement.

Standards: None, building foundations for H2-PS-2 Motion and stability.

Vocabulary: distance (d), velocity (v), acceleration (a), time (t)

Equations:
  
  * velocity = slope of distance
  * acceleration = slope of velocity

## Assessment
  * Students will submit their graphs indicating the motion of a thrown object
  * Quiz matching vocabulary to the different terms


## Outline

  1. Students come up with 3 examples of motion in games, either physical or virtual
  2. Lecture defining vocabulary and demonstrating how to calculate the velocity and acceleration.
  3. Graph match activity.
  4. Plot the movement, calculate the velocity, and acceleration by hand (2nd day)
  5. Note quiz at the end of the day
  6. Extra credit if you can make an excel sheet that will do the appropriate calcuations by hand before the next class

### Day 1
Students will do the graph match activity from Vernier to develope a physical sense of the relationship between graphs and motion.

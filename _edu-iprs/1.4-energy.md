Students will construct a roller coaster and measure & compare the KE and PE at four different points, the beginning, the lowest point, some middle point, and the end.

Standards: [3.2](/edu-standards/3.2), [3.3](/edu-standards/3.3)

Vocabulary: energy (E), kinetic energy (KE), potential energy (PE)

Equations:

  * KE = $$\frac{1}{2} mv^2$$, (one half) x (mass) x (velocity squared)
  * PE = $$mgh$$, (mass) x (gravity) x (height)

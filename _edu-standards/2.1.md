Analyze data to support the claim that Newtonâ€™s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.

    Clarification Statement: Examples of data could include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object sliding down a ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force.

     Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one-dimensional motion and to macroscopic objects moving at non-relativistic speeds.

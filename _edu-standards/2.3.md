Apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a
macroscopic object during a collision.

<!--more-->

    Clarification Statement: Examples of evaluation and refinement could include determining the success of the device at protecting an object from damage and modifying the design to improve it. Examples of a device could include a football helmet or a parachute.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to qualitative evaluations and/or algebraic manipulations.

## Ideas
  * Could have a 1-d collsion and show that the largest net change in momentum demonstrates that the maximum energy has been absorbed.  Meaning students will have to put a 'bumper' on a car, and then have a collision and measure the momemtum before and after.

Refine the design of a chemical system by specifying a change in conditions that would produce increased amounts of products at equilibrium.

<!--more--> 

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the application of Le Chatelierâ€™s Principle and on refining designs of chemical reaction systems, including descriptions of the connection between changes made at the macroscopic level and what happens at the molecular level. Examples of designs could include different ways to increase product formation including adding reactants or removing products.
    
    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to specifying the change in only one variable at a time. Assessment does not include calculating equilibrium constants and concentrations.

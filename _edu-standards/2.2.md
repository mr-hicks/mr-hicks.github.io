Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is
conserved when there is no net force on the system.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the quantitative conservation of momentum in interactions and the qualitative meaning of this principle.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems of two macroscopic bodies moving in one dimension.

Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in the functioning of designed materials.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the attractive and repulsive forces that determine the functioning of the material. Examples could include why electrically conductive materials are often made of metal, flexible but durable materials are made up of long chained molecules, and pharmaceuticals are designed to interact with specific receptors.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to provided molecular structures of specific designed materials.

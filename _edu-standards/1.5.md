    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on student reasoning that focuses on the number and energy of collisions between molecules.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to simple reactions in which there are only two reactants; evidence from temperature, concentration, and rate data; and qualitative relationships between rate and temperature.

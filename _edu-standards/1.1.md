Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of
electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms.

    Clarification Statement: Examples of properties that could be predicted from patterns could include reactivity of metals, types of bonds formed, numbers of bonds formed, and reactions with oxygen.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to main group elements. Assessment does not include quantitative understanding of ionization energy beyond relative trends.

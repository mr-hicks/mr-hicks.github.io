Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved during
a chemical reaction.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using mathematical ideas to communicate the proportional relationships between masses of atoms in the reactants and the products, and the translation of these relationships to the macroscopic scale using the mole as the conversion from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. Emphasis is on assessing studentsâ€™ use of mathematical thinking and not on memorization and rote application of problem- solving techniques.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include complex chemical reactions.

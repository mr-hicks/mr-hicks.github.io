    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on explaining the meaning of mathematical expressions used in the model.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to basic algebraic expressions or computations; to systems of two or three components; and to thermal energy, kinetic energy, and/or the energies in gravitational, magnetic, or electric fields.
